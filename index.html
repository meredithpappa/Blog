        <h3>My journey to programming, Oct 21, 2023</h3>
                <p>It all started when I watched my husband attend a programming bootcamp and saw how much he was learning as well as the interesting projects he was building on his own or with his class. I was intrigued and wanted to learn more.</p>

        <img src="images/meredith.jpg" width="100px" height="100px">
      
        <p>I've been a pianist my entire life. I originally taught at University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, Tx and maintained a studio of pre-collegiate students for many years. When I moved to Greece, I started off as an English teacher, but eventually grew interested in programming when my husband started a boot camp. I decided to give FreeCodeCamp a try and discovered I liked building different projects and that's how I ended up in InTechGration's bootcamp.</p>
